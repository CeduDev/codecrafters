## About The Project

This repository is for my <a target="_blank" href="https://codecrafters.io/">Codecrafters</a> code, where I get to build famous dev-tools - such as Git, Kafka, Docker etc. - from scratch!

Each course exists in its own directory as a submodule, since Codecrafters uses Git to run tests. When I am done with a course, I will add it as a non-submodule to allow for access to my code.
